# Epilogue

I want to write a database!!

I want to call my database _Epilogue_ (like a "sequel", but smaller). Querying the Overmind in its gopher aspect for _epilogue database_, it looks like [dchester/epilogue](https://github.com/dchester/epilogue) may have scooped me on this naming idea by five years. That's probably OK.
